                <p>With over 500 acres stretching across rolling hills and breathtaking golf theater, Valhalla Golf Club features impeccable course conditions and an exceptional experience for Members and guests alike. Valhalla is the only private golf club owned and operated by the PGA of America. Designed by all-time major Champion Jack Nicklaus, Valhalla’s quality is unparalleled in the Bluegrass State.

                    This thrilling, challenging layout is where Tiger Woods held off Bob May in a riveting three-hole PGA Championship playoff and where the United States prevailed in pulsating fashion to reclaim the Ryder Cup.

                </br>
                    As an Audubon-certified golf course, the vast wildlife of Valhalla will make you pause in appreciation. With 256 acres of sanctuary, the birds and animals in their natural habitat elevate your surroundings to a preserve of peace and tranquility. Gently meandering through the course is beautiful Floyd’s Fork, a defining stream that will come into play as both picturesque scenery and tactical strategy each time you experience Valhalla.
